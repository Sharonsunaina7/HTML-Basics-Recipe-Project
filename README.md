# Sharon's Cooking Recipes - Paneer Butter Masala

Welcome to my **Cooking Recipes Repository**! 🍽️✨

I have just started working on this, and soon, I will be back with my **own website** featuring detailed recipes, enhanced designs, and improved functionality. However, since I have already worked on multiple versions of this code, I am uploading this as a **reference for beginners** who want to learn the basics of structuring an HTML page for a recipe.

## About This Project
This repository contains an **HTML-only** file showcasing a step-by-step guide for making **Paneer Butter Masala**, one of India's most beloved dishes. The page includes:
- A **description** of the dish 🍛
- A **list of ingredients** 🥘
- **Step-by-step instructions** 📜
- **Images** to make learning more visual 🖼️
- A **simple, beginner-friendly structure** for HTML learners 🏗️

## Key HTML Concepts Used
This project introduces several important HTML elements that are helpful for beginners:

### 1️⃣ `<div>` - **Container for Sections**
Used to structure the page and group elements together.

### 2️⃣ `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` - **Headings**
Define different levels of headings for better readability.

### 3️⃣ `<p>` - **Paragraphs**
Used to add descriptive text in a structured format.

### 4️⃣ `<ul>` & `<li>` - **Lists**
An unordered list (`<ul>`) is used for the ingredients, with each item wrapped in `<li>`.

### 5️⃣ `<img>` - **Images**
Used to display pictures related to the recipe. Ensure to use proper **file paths** to load images correctly.

### 6️⃣ `style` Attribute - **Inline CSS**
Used to apply basic styling like background color, font, and alignment.

### 7️⃣ `<br>` - **Line Breaks**
Used to separate text where necessary without needing a new paragraph.

## How Beginners Can Use This Repository
- 📝 **Learn HTML basics** by analyzing the structure
- 🎨 **Experiment with styling** by modifying inline CSS
- 🖼️ **Replace images** with your own dish pictures
- 🍳 **Try adding more recipes** following the same format

## Future Plans
🚀 As I progress, I plan to:
- Convert this into a **fully responsive website**
- Add **CSS stylesheets** for better design
- Implement **JavaScript features** for interactivity
- Possibly **convert it into a web app** for easy access

If you’re a beginner, feel free to **explore, modify, and learn** from this project! Stay tuned for updates. 😊

### 🌟 Happy Coding & Cooking! 🌟
